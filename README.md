## 📝 What I Learned

This project was a great opportunity to solidify the core concepts I learned from my first project. Key takeaways include:

-   **Reinforcing React Router skills:** I practiced creating dynamic routes (`/posts/:id`) and handling navigation between a list view and a detail view.
-   **First practical experience with Tailwind CSS:** I moved from theory to practice, building a fully responsive layout and custom card components using utility-first classes.
-   **Component Reusability:** I created a reusable `PostItem` component to keep the code clean and maintainable (DRY principle).
